# User's home directory config

This is copy of my home config kicad directory

    ~/.config/kicad/

It seems that newly installed kicad 5 debian
doesn't by default set all paths correctly.

Opening ulx4m project shows many schematics simbols
as question marks.

Manually copying this config to user's home config
seems to help.
